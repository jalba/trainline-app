## Trainline App


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), but heavily modified to make it more nimble and not to use Jest, but Mocha as a test runner.

### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies of the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner. In this case Mocha.
